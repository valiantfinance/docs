## Introduction

Welcome to the Valiant API!

The Valiant API is a [RESTful](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) API with predictable, resource-oriented URLs, and uses semantic HTTP response codes to indicate API errors. Our API supports [cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing), allowing you to securely consume our API from any client-side web application. [JSON](http://www.json.org/) is returned by all resource related API responses and all API requests must be made over [`HTTPS`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Secure). The API follows version 1.0 of the [`json:api`](http://jsonapi.org/) specification for all resource related requests and responses.

## Sandbox

As a part of on-boarding we will provide both a set of Sandbox and Production API credentials. All endpoint paths for both APIs are the same however the root domain differs as detailed below.

* **Sandbox** â€“ [`https://mercury-summer.valiant.finance/`](https://mercury-summer.valiant.finance/)
* **Production** â€“ [`https://valiant.finance/`](https://valiant.finance/)

To test the API Sandbox we recommend using [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/). We couldn't live without it! ðŸ“®
